# Security Guide

This guide covers the security measures built into the Invoice Liquidity Network (ILN), how to report vulnerabilities, best practices for integrators, audit information, and the incident response process.

For the protocol-level attack surface analysis, see the [Threat Model](./threat-model.md).
For package provenance verification, see [Security](./security.md).

## Security Overview

ILN protects three classes of assets:

| Asset | Protection mechanism |
|---|---|
| On-chain funds (XLM, USDC) | Smart contract authorization; only the designated account can sign |
| Transaction integrity | Transactions are built, simulated, and submitted from the same validated object |
| Off-chain service data | Rate limiting, request timeouts, pagination caps, and input validation at API boundaries |

**Trust model:**

- Users sign transactions locally in their own wallet. The SDK never holds private keys.
- Off-chain services (indexer, notifications) observe on-chain events but are not authoritative for balances or final state — only the network is.
- Every API response, SDK input, and wallet connection is treated as potentially attacker-controlled until validated.
- SLSA Level 3 provenance attestations are published with every SDK release, proving that packages were built by the official GitHub Actions workflow and not from a developer machine.

## Vulnerability Reporting Process

**Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly until a fix has been issued.**

### How to report

| Channel | Details |
|---|---|
| GitHub Security Advisory | Open a private advisory at the repository's **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability** |
| Email | security@invoiceliquidity.network |

### What to include

- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions.
- Estimated impact (funds at risk, affected users, protocol scope).
- Any potential mitigations you have identified.

### Response timeline

| Stage | SLA |
|---|---|
| Acknowledgment | Within 48 hours |
| Triage and severity assignment | Within 5 business days |
| Fix for Critical severity | Within 14 days |
| Fix for High severity | Within 30 days |
| Fix for Medium/Low severity | Best effort in the next release cycle |

### Severity classification

| Severity | Definition |
|---|---|
| Critical | Fund drainage from smart contracts, authentication bypass, total system compromise |
| High | Significant data breach, unauthorized state manipulation with limited financial impact |
| Medium | Denial of service, localized data leaks |
| Low | UI spoofing, minor bugs with no direct financial or data impact |

### Bug bounty

Valid Critical vulnerabilities reported privately that result in a patch may be eligible for a bug bounty reward, determined on a case-by-case basis.

Researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities are acknowledged in `HALL_OF_FAME.md`.

## Security Best Practices

### For SDK integrators

**Transaction validation**

- Always re-simulate a transaction before presenting it to the user for signing. Never trust a simulation result cached from an earlier operation.
- Validate the source account, fee, time bounds, and memo fields before signing. The SDK rejects unexpected values, but host applications should apply their own checks.

```typescript
// Build and simulate in the same call to avoid stale state
const { transaction } = await sdk.buildWriteTransaction(...);
// Inspect before presenting to user wallet
```

**Wallet provider verification**

- Detect the Freighter wallet via its published extension ID, not via duck-typing on `window.freighter`.
- Do not trust wallet providers injected by unknown browser extensions.

**Dependency management**

- Pin your lockfile (`pnpm-lock.yaml` or equivalent) and review changes to transitive dependencies on every update.
- Verify SDK package provenance after install:

```bash
npm audit signatures @invoice-liquidity/sdk
```

Expected output:
```
1 package has a verified registry signature
1 package has a verified attestation
```

**Environment variables**

- Never commit `.env` files or private keys to version control.
- Use short-lived credentials for signing on CI/CD. Rotate secrets immediately if they are accidentally exposed.
- Separate read-only RPC endpoints from write endpoints in production.

### For node operators and self-hosters

**Rate limiting**

The indexer and notifications services enforce per-IP request quotas. Configure `RATE_LIMIT_WHITELIST` with your own monitoring IPs so health checks are not throttled.

```env
RATE_LIMIT_WHITELIST=10.0.0.5,10.0.0.6
```

**Network hardening**

- Do not expose the Soroban RPC port (8000) or the node communication port (11626) to the public internet.
- Place the indexer and notifications API behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS.

**Database**

- Restrict filesystem permissions on `indexer.db` and `notifications.sqlite` to the service user.
- Include database files in your backup and incident recovery plan.

## Audit Information

### Package provenance (SLSA Level 3)

All ILN npm packages (`@invoice-liquidity/sdk`, `@invoice-liquidity/cli`) are published with [SLSA Level 3](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels#build-l3) provenance attestations. Each attestation links the published tarball to the exact GitHub Actions workflow run and commit SHA that built it.

**Verify via npm:**

```bash
npm audit signatures @invoice-liquidity/sdk
```

**Verify via GitHub CLI:**

```bash
gh attestation verify \
  $(npm pack @invoice-liquidity/sdk --dry-run 2>/dev/null | tail -1) \
  --repo Invoice-Liquidity-Network/Invoice-Liquidity-Network
```

A successful verification prints the attestation details including the workflow run URL and commit SHA.

### Smart contract audits

The Soroban smart contract is the authoritative source for on-chain state. Before each major protocol version, the contract is reviewed for:

- Authorization logic and account validation
- State transition correctness (invoice lifecycle)
- Integer overflow and arithmetic edge cases
- Reentrancy and cross-contract call risks

Audit reports are published in the repository under `contracts/audits/` when available. The current audit status for the deployed contract version is documented in [Deployment Infrastructure](./deployment/infrastructure.md).

### Dependency scanning

CI runs `pnpm audit` and license compliance checks on every pull request. The workflow enforces an 80% test-coverage floor and includes mutation testing to validate test quality.

## Incident Response

### Step 1 — Detect

Monitor service health using `scripts/monitor.sh`. Integrate it into your CI and alerting pipeline. Signs of an active incident include:

- Unexpected fund movements on-chain.
- Health check failures for the indexer or notifications service.
- Anomalous error rates in SDK operations.
- Reports from users via GitHub Security Advisories or the security email.

### Step 2 — Contain

- Pause new invoice submissions and funding operations in the frontend if funds are at risk.
- Isolate the affected service (indexer, notifications, or the contract) by cutting its network access without stopping other components.
- Capture logs and database snapshots before any remediation so evidence is preserved.

### Step 3 — Report

- Open a private GitHub Security Advisory immediately, even if the full scope is unknown.
- Notify the security team at security@invoiceliquidity.network with the initial assessment.
- Do not post details in public channels (Discord, Twitter, GitHub Issues) until a fix is deployed.

### Step 4 — Remediate

- Develop and test the fix in a private branch.
- For smart contract vulnerabilities: coordinate an emergency contract upgrade or governance proposal.
- For SDK vulnerabilities: publish a patched release with SLSA attestation and notify downstream integrators via the security advisory.
- For off-chain service vulnerabilities: deploy the patched service and rotate any compromised credentials.

### Step 5 — Disclose

After the fix is deployed and downstream integrators have had time to update:

1. Publish the GitHub Security Advisory publicly.
2. Add the reporting researcher to `HALL_OF_FAME.md`.
3. Publish a post-mortem summarizing the timeline, root cause, and mitigations taken.
