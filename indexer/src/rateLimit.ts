/**
 * Builds a per-IP rate limiter for the public indexer API.
 *
 * This is a factory (rather than a module-level singleton) so each
 * `createApp()` call gets its own independent counter store - matching
 * `createApp`'s own "fresh app per call" design and keeping tests that
 * create multiple apps from leaking rate-limit state into each other.
 *
 * Defaults to 100 requests/minute per IP (configurable via
 * RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS / RATE_LIMIT_MAX). Blocked requests get a 429 with
 * a Retry-After header; every response carries RateLimit-Limit,
 * RateLimit-Remaining, and RateLimit-Reset headers.
 *
 * IPs listed in RATE_LIMIT_WHITELIST (comma-separated) bypass the limiter
 * entirely, so internal services and monitoring are never throttled.
